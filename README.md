# Location selection

Figures out what port to select for a given app.

For now it only works for my apps.

# Environment variables

These environment variables are set to the url of their application

```bash
EXPRESS_AUTHENTICATION_KEYWORD = APP_URL
BACKDOOR_SERVER_ACCESS_KEYWORD = APP_URL
REAL_ESTATE_KEYWORD = APP_URL
```
